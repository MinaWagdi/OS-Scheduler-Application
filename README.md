# OS-Scheduler-Application
Application to perform different scheduling algorithms on processes.


This projects supports many scheduling algorithms:

* First Come First Served Scheduling algorithm
* Shortest Job First Scheduling non-preemptive
* Priority Scheduling algorithm Non-Preemptive
* Round Robin Scheduling
* Shortest Job First Scheduling Preemptive
* Priority Scheduling algorithm Preemptive

_It also supports GAP handling_
